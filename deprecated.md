# Deprecated

Officially this project has been deprecated, and replaced by the tool Ryanna.
I was never fully satisfied about this builder, ya know.
If you still want to use this tool, go ahead, and if you want some stuff fixed, just report it and maybe I'll look into it. I will not really look into true improvements anymore... Only bugfixes may be done.
If you want to take over this project, let me know, and I may even transfer this repository to your account, or you may create a new repository, whatever.
My only condition is that this tool is no GPL3 licensed, and it has to remain in the GPL3 license. This tool is free, and for as long as it exists, it had to remain that way.
